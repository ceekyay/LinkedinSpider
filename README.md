# LinkedinSpider
Python based LinkedIn crawler, using Selenium. The purpose of this crawler is to automatically apply for suggested jobs on your
profile. I built this to learn Selenium. 

**NOTE**: This is just for testing & learning purposes. LinkedIn has a strict rule against web scraping. Please go through their rules
